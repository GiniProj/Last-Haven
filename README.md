Game Overview:

Last Haven is a survival game set during a zombie apocalypse, where players must take charge of a fortified prison and transform it into a safe haven for the living. As the leader, you’ll need to defend against relentless zombie hordes, repair and reinforce the prison's perimeter, and fend off hostile human raiders. Managing vital resources like food, water, and medicine will be critical to sustaining your group and ensuring their survival in a world overrun by zombies.

Gameplay Features:

Single-player & Co-op Missions: Play solo or team up with others for cooperative missions. While the game is primarily solo, co-op missions will add variety and teamwork dynamics.
Zombie Defense & Combat: Engage in direct combat with zombies, using an array of weapons to protect your prison. Fortify the fences, repair structures, and actively fight off the undead.
Resource Management: Monitor and manage crucial resources—food, water, medicine, and ammunition. Go on risky supply runs to gather essential items for survival.
Survival Goal: The main goal is to survive as long as possible. Keep the fences intact, ensure your group has enough supplies, and protect against zombie waves and raids from hostile survivors.
Challenging Difficulty: As time progresses, the game ramps up in difficulty with larger zombie hordes, increased raids, and fewer resources, testing your survival and management skills.
Game Mechanics:

Fences & Defense: The prison fences are the primary defense against zombies. If the fences break, the prison will be overrun, and you lose the game.
Supply Runs: Go out on supply runs to gather food, water, medicine, and weapons. Each supply run is a risk, as you'll encounter both zombies and scarce resources.
Combat & Weapons: Use various weapons, from melee to ranged, to fend off zombies and hostile survivors. The more fortified your defenses, the better your chances of holding off larger waves.
Resource Gauges: Keep an eye on gauges for food, water, and medicine to know when it's time to restock. Efficient resource management is key to surviving longer.
