Last Haven
Survive the Dead. Defend the Living.

Last Haven is a gripping survival game where players must transform a fortified prison into a safe haven in the midst of a relentless zombie apocalypse. Take command of resources, fend off the undead, and defend the living as you fight to sustain life within the crumbling walls.

Game Overview
In Last Haven, you will:

Manage and Defend: Protect the prison’s perimeters and fortify against waves of zombies and occasional raider attacks.
Resource Management: Carefully ration food, water, and medicine, undertaking risky supply runs to keep the camp alive.
Engage in Combat: Face off against zombie hordes with a variety of weapons and tactics.
Coordinate and Survive: Form strategies and make difficult decisions to ensure the survival of your group.
The primary goal is simple yet challenging: survive as long as possible, reinforcing the prison, managing vital resources, and fighting off ever-increasing threats.
